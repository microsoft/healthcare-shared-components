        // it is clear that in the future Microsoft.Data.SqlClient will allow the user to examine the exception thrown by the SQL server, in order to decide if the sql statement that caused
        // the exception should be retried. This is in addition to the list of default errors that always cause the retry. The current implementation of the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient does not allow
        // us to add more errors to the list of the existing errors, we can only replace the list of default errors with our own list.
        // So, as a temporary solution we copy in here the list of default retriable errors from Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and add our own retriable errors, and then supply the entire list to the
        // SqlRetryLogicOption. In the meantime, until Microsoft.Data.SqlClient retry functionality is finished we periodicaly check Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to see if the default list of errors
        // has changed in order to update the list in here. And once Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is finished we remove this temporary solution and modify our code to properly handle additional
        // retriable transient errors.
