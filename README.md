# Releasing
To publish Nuget packages, you must create a release using the GitHub release feature. The release should be 
tagged with a version like `1.0.0-master-{yyyymmdd}-{daily iteration}`. For example if you wanted to create a release
on March 4, 2020 the version would be `1.0.0-master-20200304-1`. If you wanted to create a second release on that
date, the version would be `1.0.0-master-20200304-2`.

Publishing a release will envoke the [.NET Core Build & Publish workflow](.github/workflows/dotnetbuildpublish.yml)
and publish the Nugets with the version specified to the GitHub package repository.
